ACTIONS REQUIRED TO HOST A STATIC WEBSITE USING S3.

Simple Storage Service is referred to as S3. This service is provided by AWS to give customers limitless data storage. 
In order to use S3, buckets must first be created. Consider S3 bucket as a file manager that contains files, folders, and subfolders.
A region must be chosen when creating an S3 Bucket. Always choose one based on where you are.
A static website has web pages with pre-written content that always shows the same data to users.

Make sure you have the website's source code ready on your computer so you can upload it as needed before you start.
Keep in mind that we'll be using the standard tier, which offers high availability because it keeps our data across three regions.

STEP 1 - CREATE BUCKET
To open the S3 Management Console, locate S3 in the AWS console.
Click the "create bucket" button in the bucket window.
Enter the information for your bucket, such as name and region, in the new window.
To make your bucket public, uncheck the "Block public access setting" box and click Acknowledge.
Enable encryption and bucket versioning but leave all other features at their default settings.
Next, select "Create bucket."

STEP 2 - UPLOAD
Click the upload button after selecting the newly created bucket.
Your source code's contents can be uploaded using the add files or folder feature or by dragging and dropping them from your computer into the box given.
Click the upload button to continue, and then the exit button upload is completed.

STEP 3 - WEB HOSTING
Find the "static website hosting" tab by going to the properties tab of the bucket you just made and scrolling down.
After clicking edit, choose enable.
The hosting type should remain "host a static website."
Enter the name of your index document—the.html file—and any error documents you may have in the corresponding text field.
To access your website, click the Save Changes button and then click the link provided.

STEP 4 - PERMISSIONS
Simply select "make public" from the permissions overview in the bucket's permissions tab.
Similar to that, scroll down to bucket policy if you're missing that block and click  "Edit".
We'll be including a policy that grants read-only access to the newly established bucket to anonymous users. From the AWS Docs, we can obtain a functional json code.
Look up the "read-only access for anonymous users" policy, copy it, and paste it into the bucket policy.
Change the bucket arn on the line that starts with "Resource" to the one you can see in the bucket policy window's top left corner.
Save your modifications and reload the tab in which you opened the provided URL to your site. You have used AWS S3 to successfully run a static website.

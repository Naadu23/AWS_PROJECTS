Adding Users to Groups.

Click "user" in the left panel to return to the users' window.
Choose a user from the user window. Let's choose the newly created Admin user. Remove "administrator access" from the permissions tab, then click detach on the pop-up that appears.
Select "groups" from the same window that displays the selected user. Select "Add User to Group."
Click "Add to group" after selecting the group to which you granted Administrator access.
